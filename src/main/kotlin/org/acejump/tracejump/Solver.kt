/*
 * Solves the Tag Assignment Problem. The tag assignment problem can be stated
 * thusly: Given a set of indices I in document d, and a set of tags T, find a
 * bijection f: T*⊂T → I*⊂I s.t. d[i..k] + t ∉ d[i'..(k + |t|)], ∀ i' ∈ I\{i},
 * ∀ k ∈ (i, |d|-|t|], where t ∈ T, i ∈ I. Maximize |I*|. This can be relaxed
 * to t=t[0] and ∀ k ∈ (i, i+K] for some fixed K, in most natural documents.
 *
 * More concretely, tags are typically two-character strings containing alpha-
 * numeric symbols. Documents are plaintext files. Indices are produced by a
 * search query of length N, i.e. the preceding N characters of every index i in
 * document d are identical. For characters proceeding d[i], all bets are off.
 * We can assume that P(d[i]|d[i-1]) has some structure for d~D. Ultimately, we
 * want a fast algorithm which maximizes the number of tagged document indices.
 *
 * Tags are used by the typist to select indices within a document. To select an
 * index, the typist starts by activating AceJump and searching for a character.
 * As soon as the first character is received, we begin to scan the document for
 * matching locations and assign as many valid tags as possible. When subsequent
 * characters are received, we refine the search results to match either:
 *
 *    1.) The plaintext query alone, or
 *    2.) The concatenation of plaintext query and partial tag
 *
 * The constraint in paragraph no. 1 tries to impose the following criteria:
 *
 *    1.) All valid key sequences will lead to a unique location in the document
 *    2.) All indices in the document will be reachable by a short key sequence
 *
 * If there is an insufficient number of two-character tags to cover every index
 * (which typically occurs for a common character in a long document), then we
 * attempt to maximize the number of tags assigned to document indices. The key
 * is, all tags must be assigned as soon as possible, i.e. as soon as the first
 * character is received or when the typist ceases typing (at the very latest).
 * Once assigned, a visible tag must never change during the selection process.
